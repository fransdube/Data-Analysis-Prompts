# Data-Analysis-Prompts
I need to analyze a COVID-19 dataset for a Data Analysis module. Requirements: - Dataset must be free and publicly available (Kaggle, WHO, CDC, etc.) - Should include: date, cases, deaths, recoveries, location, and demographic data - Should be recent (2023-2024) and have good documentation
